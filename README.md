Intro to programming: Wordle task for the Final Project

## Program outline:
Guess-My-Word is a command-line clone of the popular word guessing game Wordle. Players are given six tries to guess a five-letter word. After each attempt, the program gives clues about the accuracy of the guess. The player uses the clues to adapt their responses.
The player must use a valid 5-letter word in the English language for each attempt.
The game ends when the correct word is guessed (win) or when the number of attempts is exhausted (loss).
